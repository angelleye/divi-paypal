= PayPal WP Button Manager Compatibility =
If you are using our [PayPal WP Button Manager](https://www.angelleye.com/product/wordpress-paypal-button-manager/) plugin to create buttons, or if you would like to install it and use it to create and manage buttons, you will then be able to easily add buttons created by the Button Manager through the PayPal Button Divi module.

= Divi Theme by Elegant Themes Compatibility =
This plugin is built specifically for the Divi theme.  If you would like to add PayPal buttons to a non-Divi WordPress site, take a look at our [PayPal WP Button Manager](https://www.angelleye.com/product/wordpress-paypal-button-manager/) plugin.

= Quality Control =
Payment processing can't go wrong.  It's as simple as that.  Our certified PayPal engineers have developed and thoroughly tested this plugin on the PayPal sandbox (test) servers to ensure your customers don't have problems paying you.  

= Seamless PayPal Integration =
No more leaving the WordPress admin panel to log in to PayPal, create your button, copy HTML code, return to WordPress to paste the code, and finally save your page.  Instead, simply drop the button into the page using the Divi module and you're done within seconds!

= Localization = 
This plugin was developed with localization in mind and is ready for translation.

If you're interested in helping translate please [let us know](http://www.angelleye.com/contact-us/)!

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* Divi Theme by Elegant Themes

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of PayPal for Divi, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type PayPal for Divi and click Search Plugins. Once you've found our plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking Install Now.

= Manual Installation =

1. Unzip the files and upload the folder into your plugins folder (wp-content/plugins/) overwriting old versions if they exist
2. Activate the plugin in your WordPress admin area.
 
= Usage = 

1. Open/Edit any page that uses the Divi Page Builder.
2. Click to add a new module to any section of your page / post, and you will find a PayPal Button module
3. Configure your settings accordingly.

= Updating = 

Automatic updates should work great for you.  As always, though, we recommend backing up your site prior to making any updates just to be sure nothing goes wrong.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I create sandbox accounts for testing? =

* Login at http://developer.paypal.com.  
* Click the Applications tab in the top menu.
* Click Sandbox Accounts in the left sidebar menu.
* Click the Create Account button to create a new sandbox account.
* TIP: Create at least one "seller" account and one "buyer" account if you want to fully test Express Checkout or other PayPal wallet payments. 
* TUTORIAL: See our [step-by-step instructions with video guide](https://www.angelleye.com/create-paypal-sandbox-account/).

= I recently updated the plugin, but the changes do not seem to be taking affect.  Why? =

* The Divi theme utilizes your browser's "local storage" to improve the performance of the Divi Builder.  This does not clear even if you clear your browser cache and history.  If it seems that updates are not taking affect, try to disable and re-enable the plugin, which should clear the browser's locale storage and resolve the issue.

= Can I create more than just Buy Now and Donate buttons? =

* We have plans to expand upon this PayPal for Divi module.  In the mean-time, take a look at our free [PayPal WP Button Manager](https://www.angelleye.com/product/wordpress-paypal-button-manager/) plugin, which allows you to build a variety of PayPal buttons within WordPress.
